# Nepal Health Analytics Prototype

## Overview
This project is a **health analytics prototype** for **population segmentation & risk stratification** in Nepal. It demonstrates how **data science and software engineering** can work together to support public health decision-making using dummy data and a Spring Boot backend.

- **notebooks/** : Jupyter notebooks (learning & prototype)
- **Nepal Segmentation Project** : Spring Boot backend

## How to Run Spring Boot API
```bash
cd "Nepal Segmentation Project"
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## EndPoint:
 ```bash
/api/segments/kpi
 ```

## Learning Goals
- **Feature Engineering & Risk Scoring** : Creating BMI categories, lifestyle & socioeconomic risk scores
- **Data Analyst Role** : Handling and understanding datasets, preparing them for analysis
- **Business Analyst Role** : Defining KPIs, interpreting segments, translating insights for decision-making
- **Software Engineer Role** : Building clean, scalable APIs, connecting backend to front-end dashboard
